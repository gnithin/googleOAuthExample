This is an Android application to demonstrate basic OAuth2 authentication by obtaining tokens from google, using AccountManager.

Basic Overview-
The application contains 2 activites - chooseAccount and LoggedIn, accompanied by two helper classes loginTask and AuthPreferences.
LoggedIn is the launcher Activity. This activity will be rendered only when the user has logged in.
ChooseAccount displays a Dialog to choose the account.
AuthPreferences contains the Shared Preferences which will be persisitent across all the activities.
loginTask is the abstract class which contains all the necessary methods. All the activities extend this class.

The server side validation for the tokens from this application is demonstrated by me in this link-
